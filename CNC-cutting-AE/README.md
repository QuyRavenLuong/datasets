# AE of CNC cutting

This dataset consists of AE signals captured by AE sensors which were mounted into the OptiMill F80 CNC machine.
It is intended for studying and experimenting with data-based approaches for AE-based monitoring of the machine and process.

# Sensor placement

Two sensors were integrated manually into the machine. Hereby, one was placed close to the spindle, one other was placed on the movable table of the CNC machine.

## Process

- Material: 1.4305
- Dimensions: 280 x 150 x 30 mm

The material was cut row by row along its width with various tools of differing conditions and under same process parameters.

## Measurement

- LinWave
- Settings:
  - Samplerate: 1 MHz
  - Input Range: 
    - Sensor 1: 5000 mV 
    - Sensor 2: 50 mV

## Files

All files can be requested here: quy.raven.luong@uni-a.de.

Each measurement consists of two binary files:

- The binary files consist of int16 values, which form an array that represents the raw structure-borne noise of the CNC cutting process
- Each binary belongs to one sensor
- Each measurement contains 7 or 9 cutting processes that were monitored.
  - First 2 or 3 processes describe cutting steel, using a tool of healthy condition
  - Next 2 or 3 processes describe cutting steel, using a tool of worn-out condition
  - Last 3 process describe cutting steel with holes (as simulated defects), using a tool of healthy condition
